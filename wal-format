<record type as byte><record><record length as vbyte)><crc32 hash>

where record type:
- 0: label write
(<name 0-terminated string><layer as 20 bytes>)<4 byte identifier>
- 1: checkpoint
<4 byte identifier of write>

no label write should be written when another write already exists with a higher identifier
no checkpoint should be written when another checkpoint already exists with a higher identifier
